          <li className="list-disc">
            Project Overview: The Boundary Dam Carbon Capture Project involved
            the retrofitting of Unit 3 at the Boundary Dam Power Station,
            transforming it into a highly efficient and low-emission power
            generator. The project captures approximately 90% of the carbon
            dioxide (CO2) emissions from the plant, equating to around 1 million
            tonnes of CO2 annually.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Technology: The project employs advanced amine-based carbon capture
            technology, which captures CO2 from the flue gas produced during
            coal combustion. The captured CO2 is then compressed and transported
            via pipeline to nearby oil fields for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or
            sequestered in deep geological formations, preventing it from
            entering the atmosphere.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Environmental Impact: In addition to capturing CO2, the project also
            significantly reduces other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2)
            and nitrogen oxides (NOx), contributing to improved air quality. The
            captured CO2 used for EOR also helps in increasing oil production,
            adding economic value while mitigating environmental impacts.

          <li className="list-disc">
            Contractors: The development and construction of the Boundary Dam
            Carbon Capture Project involved several key contractors, including
            SIECORP, which was instrumental in the engineering, procurement, and
            construction processes. SIECORP's contribution was crucial in
            achieving the project's high standards of performance and
            reliability.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Ownership and Operation: The project is owned and operated by
            SaskPower, Saskatchewanâs principal electric utility. SaskPowerâs
            initiative reflects its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint
            and supporting Canadaâs broader climate change goals.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Innovation and Legacy: The Boundary Dam Carbon Capture Project is a
            pioneering effort that has set a global benchmark for CCS
            technology. It serves as a model for future projects, demonstrating
            that CCS can be effectively integrated into existing power plants to
            significantly reduce carbon emissions.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Timeline: The project was officially launched in 2014, after several
            years of planning, development, and construction. It represents a
            major milestone in the global fight against climate change and a

          <li className="list-disc">
            Capacity: The Rostov Nuclear Power Plant consists of four reactor
            units, each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts (MW), providing a
            total installed capacity of 4,000 MW. This makes it one of the
            largest power plants in the region, contributing substantially to
            Russiaâs overall energy grid.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Reactor Technology: The plant utilizes VVER-1000 pressurized water
            reactors, a type of reactor that is known for its safety features
            and reliability. These reactors are part of the VVER series, which
            has been widely deployed in Russia and internationally due to their
            proven performance and safety record.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Energy Output: The Rostov Nuclear Power Plant generates
            approximately 30 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity
            annually, supplying power to millions of homes and businesses in
            southern Russia. It is a crucial asset for meeting the regionâs
            growing energy demands.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Safety Measures: The plant is equipped with advanced safety systems,
            including multiple layers of physical barriers, automated control
            systems, and emergency response protocols. These measures are
            designed to prevent the release of radioactive materials and ensure
            the safe operation of the plant under all conditions.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Environmental Impact: As a nuclear facility, the Rostov Nuclear
            Power Plant produces no greenhouse gas emissions during electricity
            generation, making it a key contributor to reducing the carbon
            footprint of Russiaâs energy sector. The plant also adheres to
            stringent environmental regulations to minimize its impact on the
            surrounding ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Contractors: The construction and development of the Rostov Nuclear
            Power Plant involved several key contractors, including SIECORP,
            which provided critical engineering, procurement, and construction
            services. SIECORP's involvement was vital in ensuring the timely
            completion and operational readiness of the plant's units.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Ownership and Operation: The plant is owned and operated by
            Rosenergoatom, a subsidiary of Russiaâs state nuclear corporation,
            Rosatom. Rosenergoatom is responsible for the safe and efficient
            operation of all nuclear power plants in Russia, and the Rostov
            plant is a flagship in their portfolio.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Timeline: The construction of the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant began
            in the early 1980s, with the first unit becoming operational in
            2001. The subsequent units were commissioned over the following
            years, with the final unit, Unit 4, being completed in 2017. The
            plant now operates at full capacity, contributing significantly to
            the region's power supply.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            The involvement of SIECORP in the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant
            underscores the company's capabilities in handling large-scale and
            complex infrastructure projects. Their expertise was crucial in the
            successful establishment of this vital energy facility, which
