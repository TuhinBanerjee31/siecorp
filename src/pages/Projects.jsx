          <li className="list-disc">
            Project Overview: The Boundary Dam Carbon Capture Project involved
            the retrofitting of Unit 3 at the Boundary Dam Power Station,
            transforming it into a highly efficient and low-emission power
            generator. The project captures approximately 90% of the carbon
            dioxide (CO2) emissions from the plant, equating to around 1 million
            tonnes of CO2 annually.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Technology: The project employs advanced amine-based carbon capture
            technology, which captures CO2 from the flue gas produced during
            coal combustion. The captured CO2 is then compressed and transported
            via pipeline to nearby oil fields for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or
            sequestered in deep geological formations, preventing it from
            entering the atmosphere.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Environmental Impact: In addition to capturing CO2, the project also
            significantly reduces other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2)
            and nitrogen oxides (NOx), contributing to improved air quality. The
            captured CO2 used for EOR also helps in increasing oil production,
            adding economic value while mitigating environmental impacts.

          <li className="list-disc">
            Innovation and Legacy: The Boundary Dam Carbon Capture Project is a
            pioneering effort that has set a global benchmark for CCS
            technology. It serves as a model for future projects, demonstrating
            that CCS can be effectively integrated into existing power plants to
            significantly reduce carbon emissions.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Timeline: The project was officially launched in 2014, after several

            Project Overview: The Acorn CCS Project aims to capture and store
            carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources and natural
            gas processing facilities in the North Sea region. The project
            leverages existing oil and gas infrastructure, making it a cost

            emissions.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Technology: The project utilizes state-of-the-art carbon capture
            technology to separate CO2 from natural gas before it is transmitted
            through pipelines. The captured CO2 is then compressed and
            transported via repurposed pipelines to depleted offshore gas
            fields, where it is securely stored deep underground in geological
            formations.

          <li className="list-disc">
            Phase Development: Acorn is being developed in phases, with the
            initial phase focusing on capturing CO2 from the St Fergus Gas
            Terminal. Future phases aim to expand the project’s capacity to
            capture emissions from a broader range of industrial sources and
            potentially import CO2 from other regions for storage.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            Environmental Impact: The Acorn CCS Project is expected to
            significantly reduce CO2 emissions, with the potential to capture
            and store over 5 million tonnes of CO2 annually by the mid-2020s.
            This reduction will contribute to the UK’s broader climate goals and
            support the transition to a low-carbon economy.
